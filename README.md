### What drives you nuts?
* Meetings running in circles or without a concrete topic
* Wasting time in general and procrastination

### What are your quirks?
When topics are hard and require a proper thought, I like to prepare for myself:
* Diagrams
* Bullet lists
* Pictures
* Put here whatever that clarifies the thing...
Base on that, make decisions based on something, making it easier to explain for me to others.

Reacting to conflict, I like to talk about it as soon as possible to avoid misunderstandings.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* Sometimes at the first sight I cause a wrong impression as I have a strong character. Fun fact, one of my best friends now, hated me in the beginning
* I have days where I don't feel as talkative as others, it's not that I am angry or anything, just a little bit more low energy

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* People that is always willing to help
* People who always tells you what they think, even if it is not the most polite thing
* People who like bad jokes, I am really into it
* Being humble in general

### What do you wish colleagues didnâ€™t do?
* I don't like when people pass work to someone overloaded when they have time to do it

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* Say me the things straight
* Give me feedback to help me improve
* Teach me the new stuff you learned the other day
* Help sometimes with a [duck rubber debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). It's needed :see_no_evil:
* Grab some :beers:
